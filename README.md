🎲🎲🎲 This is my mini game build by JavaScript 🎲🎲🎲

📋 Rules of this game:



      🟡 We have 2 players (game starts with the first player) 
      🟡 Each player rolls a die and gets his points (from 2 to 6). This points are not added to main score but to current score.
      🟡 Player can roll a die while value is not 1. When it is 1 your current score has value 0 and then you can't add points to your main score.
      🟡 If player wants to add current score to main score he must press hold button.
      🟡 The player who faster got 100 points on main score wins


Hope you enjoy my project🙌
